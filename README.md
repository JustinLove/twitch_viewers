# Twitch Viewers

Display the twitch viewer count in-game.

This uses an un-authenticated public API, but you do need to enter your twitch username in the settings (server tab) so it knows which channel to check.

It will check the stream once on game start, and then continue polling if the stream is live.  Click the option bar item to poll if you start the stream later.
